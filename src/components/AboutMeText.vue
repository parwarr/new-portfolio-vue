          Hey, I’m Parwar! I’m all about getting just a little better every day,
          whether it’s learning something new in tech, solving a tricky problem,
          or experimenting with cool ideas. I love diving into different
          challenges, staying curious, and pushing myself to create things that
          actually make a difference. I’m not trying to be perfect, just trying
          to improve step by step and enjoy the process along the way. Always
          excited to explore, learn, and build something awesome!
