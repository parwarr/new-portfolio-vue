          Hello! I'm Parwar, a passionate junior full-stack developer with a knack for creating efficient and impactful
          digital solutions. With expertise in languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL, and a keen interest in
          expanding my skill set into C and C++, I'm constantly evolving in the tech sphere. My GitHub showcases
          projects ranging from a classic TicTacToe game to a dynamic Yu-Gi-Oh search engine, reflecting my versatility
          and love for challenges. I'm also proficient with Docker and Linux, ensuring my projects are not just
          innovative but also resilient and scalable. While my time might be limited for private projects currently, my
